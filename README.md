Maybe to you and me BRICK RED and CRIMSON RED are all Reds but let's say one day you wished to learn what colors does your wife wear to avoid all the hassle, this simple python app would come to your rescue. Upload a photo and simply hover your mouse over it to learn the different colors. Make sure you have pandas and opencv installed alongside python.
Make sure to have the provided py and txt file in the same directory, hover to that directory where this files are stored and then run the commands below.

Run the python file using the command
